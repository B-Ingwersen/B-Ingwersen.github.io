                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The project can be divided into three main components, the data scraping component, the data analysis and index building part, and the visualization component (which is composed of a small webserver and a HTML/Javascript frontend). Each piece provides the resources that the next one needs to function.
                </p>
                <h3>Data Scraping</h3>
                <p>
                    The raw article data comes from data dumps of all ~20 million English Wikipedia pages which Wikimedia makes available for download (as a warning if you want to run this project on you own machine, the download is abou 17 GB of compressed text data). This is obviously a bit overkill for a project that only works with math articles, but it allows the code to be easily extended to other research areas; for example, with very few adjustments, I created a version of the project that does the same things but with philosophy articles. This component also indexes all of the articles to allow for quick random access (it essentially generates a few big on-disk hash maps). The text provides enough information to understand links between articles, but two Wikipedia APIs are used to incorperate additional data. The first provides historical page view history for each article, and the other offers information about the editing history of the pages.
                </p>

                <h3>Analysis and Index Building</h3>
                <p>
                    The data analysis portion of the project allows for operating on a subset of the articles (in this case, the ones relating to mathematics), and it processes data from each of three sources mentioned above. First, it uses the text source to identify the links between articles, and performs analyses on these, such as running the PageRank algorithm. Next it takes the edit history of each article and searches for signs of unusual and potentially malicious edits (ie when a large addition or deletion is made). Additionally, it puts together statistics on each individual contributor to the articles. Finally, the page view data is used to sort articles by popularity art search for patterns, such as yearly cycles in how much interest an article gets. The group of articles being analyzed can also be broken down into further subsets. In the case of mathematics articles, this means analyzing by field of mathematics, such as statistics, geometry, calculus, etc. The analysis portion supports generating aggregate statics for these subsets.
                </p>

                <h4>Force Directed Graph Maker</h4>
                <p>
                    One interesting visualization provided is the the network graphs of articles, where each article is represented by a dot and they are connected by inter-article links. These graphs are layed out for a force directed algorithm, but this is very computationally intensive, so it is precomputed for each set of articles. A small C++ program is included in the project to accomplish this task. Since force directed graph calculations get quadratically more complex as the number of elements increases, and some article sets include 10 of thousands of data points, this program uses a Barnes–Hut simulation to more efficiently approximate the results.
                </p>

                <h3>Visualization</h3>
                <p>
                    The visualization component is driven by a small Flask-based web server. The server calls the Python code that loads and packages the data, and then it sends the information to an HTML frontend that is used in the browser (I've really inteded it to just be used locally, but it theoretically could be hosted on the Internet). Most of the visualizations use the Plotly graphing library. Due to performance issues, the force directed graphs now use some custom Javascript to render directly to an HTML canvas.
